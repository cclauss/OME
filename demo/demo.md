There are currently two simple demos.

### `michigan_mashup.py`
Make data about Lansing, Michigan from World Historical Gazetteer and Michigan Memories
available to teachers as they create new lesson plans in the OER Commons Editor.

Health Service Delivery data can also be gathered from the Moodle site of the Worldbank.

### `ome_demo.py`
